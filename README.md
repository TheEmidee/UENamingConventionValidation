# UE4 Naming Convention Validation

This plug-in allows you to make sure all assets of your project are correcly named, based on your own rules. 

You can validate individual asset names by defining a prefix and / or a suffix based on the asset type.

But you can also implement more complicated validation rules, like making sure all assets inside a folder have a keyword in their name.

Check the [documentation](https://theemidee.github.io/UENamingConventionValidation/) for all the informations.
